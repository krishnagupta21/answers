Answers at UofT is a platform where students from University of Toronto can ask questions from past year papers, job related questions, or any other general questions. The main reason this platform is developed is because every year students try to find answers to same questions that their seniors had. But these answers get lost on specific facebook groups. So this will reduce that redundancy and make students life easier.

The webapp is developed using Ruby on Rails and the various gems available.
For designing bootstrap is used.
